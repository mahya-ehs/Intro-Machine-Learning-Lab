# ORL-Clustering-Methods
ORL Dataset Clustering with DBSCAN, KMeans, and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

## Overview
This is a machine learning project that focuses on clustering the ORL dataset using various clustering methods, including DBSCAN, KMeans, and Agglomerative Clustering (single link, complete link, and average link). Additionally, the Rand Index is computed for each clustering algorithm to evaluate their performance.

## Dataset:
The ORL dataset consists of facial images from 40 different subjects, each with 10 images taken at different angles and lighting conditions.

## Usage:
simply run the .ipynb file on Google Colab or Jupyter
