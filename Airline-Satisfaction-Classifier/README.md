# Airline-Satisfaction-Classifier
This is a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the satisfaction of airline passengers using the Perceptron algorithm. Additionally, it addresses the limitations of the Perceptron algorithm on non-linearly separable data by incorporating concepts from Support Vector Machines (SVM) through the use of kernels.

## Dataset:
- **trainset:** Training data file containing various passenger information, including flight class, distance, and satisfaction labels.
- **testset:** Test data file with similar features as the training data, used to evaluate the algorithm's performance.

## Usage:
simply run the .ipynb file on Google Colab or Jupyter.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
